This Page aims to document my experience developing my own projects in any thing developer related. At the same time I would like to share things such as issues, solutions, learninging experiences, and things I develop along the way. I may occasionally add things that aren't tech or software related. Just other things I may have interest in and felt like sharing. Who knows this may even turn into a blog about Archery or gaming although I doubt it.

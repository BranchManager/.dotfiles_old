being on arch I first had to install the waybar-hyprland-git package using hte aur. you could also add a flag to the code and compile

I needed a dont so yay -S nerd-fonts. It downloads a variety of nerd fonts.
Now the icons that looked like hyroglyphs are shown. I can also ass icons to my bar. I started off with the menu.
